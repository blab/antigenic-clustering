Computation & numbers:
- fill in the the numbers
- Locate my codes and scripts and results

Figures:
[done]- use Trevor's figures (and maybe suggest changes if necessary)
[done]- too many figures, need to move some to the Supplementary
[done] properly draw my schematic figures (those in the manuscript
redraw MCMC proposal figures in the Supplementary material
- add text to the supplementary figures
- supplementary material figure 1 -  fill in the text after looking at the python titerdb code to see how I generate the figure


Coding:
- migrate code to BEAST 2.0 on github. I developed my code on 1.8. Do I need to?
- upload code to github 


text changes:
[done]- "autoregressive" model .. figure out whether it is the wrong word to use.
		- to be safe, I use "antigenic additive mdoel" instead
[done]- word change:  Method: "k" sera to 'n_s" sera for consistency
- question to think about: for H1N1, why do we not see clusters on straight line?


Others:
- need help in filling the correct reference & relating to Scientific importance
- trevor: explain the qualitative significance of the results
