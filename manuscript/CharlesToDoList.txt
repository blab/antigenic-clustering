Computation & numbers:
- fill in the the numbers


Figures:
- use Trevor's figures (and maybe suggest changes if necessary)
- too many figures, need to move some to the Supplementary
- properly draw my schematic figures (that main schematic one , MCMC proposals)
- figure 1 - fill in the text after looking at the python titerdb code to see how I generate the figure


Coding:
- migrate code to BEAST 2.0 on github. I developed my code on 1.8
- upload code to github 


text changes:
- "autoregressive" model .. figure out whether it is the wrong word to use.
- word change:  Method: "k" sera to 'n_s" sera for consistency
- question to think about: for H1N1, why do we not see clusters on straight line?


Others:
- need help in filling the correct reference & relating to Scientific importance
- trevor: explain the qualitative significance of the results
