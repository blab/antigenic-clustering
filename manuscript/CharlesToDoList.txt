Task:
- run beast to get those evaluations: (take maybe a week)
	- more runs for simulation   [done]
	- more runs for MCMC diagnostics [running]


TO DO:

0.2: set run for H1N1 at higher mds  [done]
	- look at clustering   [remind Trevor to look at it on Monday]
	- let him decide on the default MDS level

0b - Look at the manuscript, see what I have to change:
	- when h1n1 kappa = 0.3?
	- h3n2 kappa = 0.1


0c - Consensus clustering for the trees

0d - but what about the antigenic map?
	- also use consensus?

1a. manuscript text
    - revise results section [done]
    - write proper description for each figure in the manuscript
	- note which figures I will need to regenerate

1b. prepare supplementary materials   
	- redraw the MCMC schematic diagram figures [done]
	- see which figures I want to keep by looking at the texts [done]
	- add text for each supplementary figure that I decide to keep
	- note which figures I will need to regenerate when I see the new results, and find the scripts for it


3. locate my codes, run files, and scripts and results [in progress]	


2. fill in the numbers from the manuscript
	- note the list of numbers to compute

	- need to look at the scripts 
	- write codes to get those numbers I want



4. Text
	- fill in the reference
	- do a full manuscript revision to figure
	
	
5. do any unfinished section, along with Trevor's input
	

6. BEAST code

	Current state: Messy because of the different versions I used to run things
	- I have an earlier version of code used for main analysis
	- since then I have a version I uploaded to github that has organized the codes
	- I also have a version used to simulate data
	- and a version (I think it is almost identical to the version used for analyzing simulated data)

	- try to recompile the versions in a separated folder
		- try to run the XML for each version
			- goal: make sure I can rerun the analysis with those xml files

	- try to see if these codes would run on BEAST 2.0 on github
	- upload codes onto BEAST github



	

	
==========================================
Then,
	
-revise text
-fill in references


=================================================================================

Computation & numbers:
- fill in the the numbers
- run beast to get those evaluations:
	- more runs for simulation
	- more runs for MCMC diagnostics
- Locate my codes and scripts and results

Coding:
- migrate code to BEAST 2.0 on github. I developed my code on 1.8. Do I need to?
- upload code to github
- upload run results somewhere


Prepare supplementary materials
redraw MCMC proposal figures in the Supplementary material
- add text to the supplementary figures
- supplementary material figure 1 -  fill in the text after looking at the python titerdb code to see how I generate the figure


text changes:
- general text revision
- question to think about: for H1N1, why do we not see clusters on straight line?


Others:
- need help in filling the correct reference & relating to Scientific importance
- trevor: explain the qualitative significance of the results





[done]- use Trevor's figures (and maybe suggest changes if necessary)
[done]- too many figures, need to move some to the Supplementary
[done] properly draw my schematic figures (those in the manuscript

[done]- "autoregressive" model .. figure out whether it is the wrong word to use.
		- to be safe, I use "antigenic additive mdoel" instead
[done]- word change:  Method: "k" sera to 'n_s" sera for consistency
