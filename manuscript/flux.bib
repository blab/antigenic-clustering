@article{Wolf06,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The interpandemic evolution of the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein is commonly considered a paragon of rapid evolutionary change under positive selection in which amino acid replacements are fixed by virtue of their effect on antigenicity, enabling the virus to evade immune surveillance. RESULTS: We performed phylogenetic analyses of the recently obtained large and relatively unbiased samples of the HA sequences from 1995-2005 isolates of the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A virus. Unexpectedly, it was found that the evolution of H3N2 HA includes long intervals of generally neutral sequence evolution without apparent substantial antigenic change ("stasis" periods) that are characterized by an excess of synonymous over nonsynonymous substitutions per site, lack of association of amino acid replacements with epitope regions, and slow extinction of coexisting virus lineages. These long periods of stasis are punctuated by shorter intervals of rapid evolution under positive selection during which new dominant lineages quickly displace previously coexisting ones. The preponderance of positive selection during intervals of rapid evolution is supported by the dramatic excess of amino acid replacements in the epitope regions of HA compared to replacements in the rest of the HA molecule. In contrast, the stasis intervals showed a much more uniform distribution of replacements over the HA molecule, with a statistically significant difference in the rate of synonymous over nonsynonymous substitution in the epitope regions between the two modes of evolution. A number of parallel amino acid replacements - the same amino acid substitution occurring independently in different lineages - were also detected in H3N2 HA. These parallel mutations were, largely, associated with periods of rapid fitness change, indicating that there are major limitations on evolutionary pathways during antigenic change. The finding that stasis is the prevailing modality of H3N2 evolution suggests that antigenic changes that lead to an increase in fitness typically result from epistatic interactions between several amino acid substitutions in the HA and, perhaps, other viral proteins. The strains that become dominant due to increased fitness emerge from low frequency strains thanks to the last amino acid replacement that completes the set of replacements required to produce a significant antigenic change; no subset of substitutions results in a biologically significant antigenic change and corresponding fitness increase. In contrast to H3N2, no clear intervals of evolution under positive selection were detected for the H1N1 HA during the same time span. Thus, the ascendancy of H1N1 in some seasons is, most likely, caused by the drop in the relative fitness of the previously prevailing H3N2 lineages as the fraction of susceptible hosts decreases during the stasis intervals. CONCLUSION: We show that the common view of the evolution of influenza virus as a rapid, positive selection-driven process is, at best, incomplete. Rather, the interpandemic evolution of influenza appears to consist of extended intervals of stasis, which are characterized by neutral sequence evolution, punctuated by shorter intervals of rapid fitness increase when evolutionary change is driven by positive selection. These observations have implications for influenza surveillance and vaccine formulation; in particular, the possibility exists that parallel amino acid replacements could serve as a predictor of new dominant strains.

@article{Ferguson03,
	Abstract = {In pandemic and epidemic forms, influenza causes substantial, sometimes catastrophic, morbidity and mortality. Intense selection from the host immune system drives antigenic change in influenza A and B, resulting in continuous replacement of circulating strains with new variants able to re-infect hosts immune to earlier types. This 'antigenic drift' often requires a new vaccine to be formulated before each annual epidemic. However, given the high transmissibility and mutation rate of influenza, the constancy of genetic diversity within lineages over time is paradoxical. Another enigma is the replacement of existing strains during a global pandemic caused by 'antigenic shift'--the introduction of a new avian influenza A subtype into the human population. Here we explore ecological and immunological factors underlying these patterns using a mathematical model capturing both realistic epidemiological dynamics and viral evolution at the sequence level. By matching model output to phylogenetic patterns seen in sequence data collected through global surveillance, we find that short-lived strain-transcending immunity is essential to restrict viral diversity in the host population and thus to explain key aspects of drift and shift dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Computational evolutionary biology, statistical phylogenetics and coalescent-based population genetics are becoming increasingly central to the analysis and understanding of molecular sequence data. We present the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) software package version 1.7, which implements a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian phylogenetic inference, divergence time dating, coalescent analysis, phylogeography and related molecular evolutionary analyses. This package includes an enhanced graphical user interface program called Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility (BEAUti) that enables access to advanced models for molecular sequence and phenotypic trait evolution that were previously available to developers only. The package also provides new tools for visualizing and summarizing multispecies coalescent and phylogeographic analyses. BEAUti and BEAST 1.7 are open source under the GNU lesser general public license and available at http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com and http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk},

@article{Fitch97,
	Abstract = {We have studied the HA1 domain of 254 human influenza A(H3N2) virus genes for clues that might help identify characteristics of hemagglutinins (HAs) of circulating strains that are predictive of that strain's epidemic potential. Our preliminary findings include the following. (i) The most parsimonious tree found requires 1,260 substitutions of which 712 are silent and 548 are replacement substitutions. (ii) The HA1 portion of the HA gene is evolving at a rate of 5.7 nucleotide substitutions/year or 5.7 x 10(-3) substitutions/site per year. (iii) The replacement substitutions are distributed randomly across the three positions of the codon when allowance is made for the number of ways each codon can change the encoded amino acid. (iv) The replacement substitutions are not distributed randomly over the branches of the tree, there being 2.2 times more changes per tip branch than for non-tip branches. This result is independent of how the virus was amplified (egg grown or kidney cell grown) prior to sequencing or if sequencing was carried out directly on the original clinical specimen by PCR. (v) These excess changes on the tip branches are probably the result of a bias in the choice of strains to sequence and the detection of deleterious mutations that had not yet been removed by negative selection. (vi) There are six hypervariable codons accumulating replacement substitutions at an average rate that is 7.2 times that of the other varied codons. (vii) The number of variable codons in the trunk branches (the winners of the competitive race against the immune system) is 47 +/- 5, significantly fewer than in the twigs (90 +/- 7), which in turn is significantly fewer variable codons than in tip branches (175 +/- 8). (viii) A minimum of one of every 12 branches has nodes at opposite ends representing viruses that reside on different continents. This is, however, no more than would be expected if one were to randomly reassign the continent of origin of the isolates. (ix) Of 99 codons with at least four mutations, 31 have ratios of non-silent to silent changes with probabilities less than 0.05 of occurring by chance, and 14 of those have probabilities <0.005. These observations strongly support positive Darwinian selection. We suggest that the small number of variable positions along the successful trunk lineage, together with knowledge of the codons that have shown positive selection, may provide clues that permit an improved prediction of which strains will cause epidemics and therefore should be used for vaccine production.},

	Abstract = {Recent developments in complete-genome sequencing, antigenic mapping and epidemiological modelling are greatly improving our knowledge of the evolution of human influenza virus at the epidemiological scale. In particular, recent studies have revealed a more complex relationship between antigenic evolution, natural selection and reassortment than previously realized. Despite these advances, there is much that remains to be understood about the epidemiology of influenza virus, particularly the processes that determine the virus's strong seasonality. We argue that a complete understanding of the evolutionary biology of this important human pathogen will require a genomic view of genetic diversity, including the acquisition of polymorphism data from within individual hosts and from geographical regions, particularly the tropics, which have been poorly surveyed to date.},

	Abstract = {Antigenic and genetic analysis of the hemagglutinin of approximately 13,000 human influenza A (H3N2) viruses from six continents during 2002-2007 revealed that there was continuous circulation in east and Southeast Asia (E-SE Asia) via a region-wide network of temporally overlapping epidemics and that epidemics in the temperate regions were seeded from this network each year. Seed strains generally first reached Oceania, North America, and Europe, and later South America. This evidence suggests that once A (H3N2) viruses leave E-SE Asia, they are unlikely to contribute to long-term viral evolution. If the trends observed during this period are an accurate representation of overall patterns of spread, then the antigenic characteristics of A (H3N2) viruses outside E-SE Asia may be forecast each year based on surveillance within E-SE Asia, with consequent improvements to vaccine strain selection.},

	Abstract = {The antigenic evolution of influenza A (H3N2) virus was quantified and visualized from its introduction into humans in 1968 to 2003. Although there was remarkable correspondence between antigenic and genetic evolution, significant differences were observed: Antigenic evolution was more punctuated than genetic evolution, and genetic change sometimes had a disproportionately large antigenic effect. The method readily allows monitoring of antigenic differences among vaccine and circulating strains and thus estimation of the effects of vaccination. Further, this approach offers a route to predicting the relative success of emerging strains, which could be achieved by quantifying the combined effects of population level immune escape and viral fitness on strain evolution.},

@article{Faress05,
	Abstract = {Background:Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on their hemagglutinin {(H1} to H15) and neuraminidase {(N1} to N9) glycoproteins. Of these, three A subtypes {H1N1}, {H3N2} and {H1N2} circulate in the human population. Influenza A viruses display a high antigenic variability called ‚{\"A}{\'u}ntigenic drift‚{\"A}{\`u} which allows the virus to escape antibody neutralization. Objectives: Evaluate the mutations apparition that might predict a divergent antigenic evolution of hemagglutinin in influenza A {H1N1} and A {H1N2} viruses. Study Design: During the three winters of 2001‚{\"A}{\`\i}2002 to 2003‚{\"A}{\`\i}2004, 58 A {H1N1} and 23 A {H1N2} subtypes have been isolated from patients with influenza-like illness in the south of France. The {HA1} region was analyzed by {RT-PCR} and subsequently sequenced to compare the {HA1} genetic evolution of influenza A {H1N1} and A {H1N2} subtypes. Results: Our results showed that 28 amino acid substitutions have accumulated in the {HA1} region since the circulation of {A/New} Caledonia/20/99-like viruses in France. Of these, fifteen were located in four antigenic sites {(B}, C, D and E). Six of them were observed only in the A {H1N2} isolates, six only in the A {H1N1} isolates and three in both subtypes. Furthermore, nine of twenty two A {H1N2} isolates from the winter of 2002‚{\"A}{\`\i}2003 shared a {T90A} amino acid change which has not been observed in any A {H1N1} isolate; resulting in the introduction of a new glycosylation site close to the antigenic site E. This might mask some antigenic E determinants and therefore, modify the A {H1N2} antigenicity. Conclusions: The divergent genetic evolution of hemagglutinin may ultimately lead to a significant different antigenicity between A {H1N1} and A {H1N2} subtypes that would require the introduction of a new subtype in the vaccine batches.},

However, a few recombinant viruses containing the new variant {HA} and genes of {H3N2} origin were identified. Antigenic analysis of {H3N2} viruses indicated that they were also heterogeneous. The majority of these virus isolates were antigenically intermediate between {A/Texas/1/77} and {A/Bangkok/1/79}, but additional variants were detected. Genomic analysis revealed that the {H3N2} viruses isolated in the winter of 1980-81 were quite similar to {H3N2} viruses isolated from 1977-79 in their T1 oligonucleotide maps. No {H1N1} genes were detected in {H3N2} virus isolates. Comparison of pairs of oligonucleotide maps of total virus {RNA} indicated that a similar rate of genetic change had occurred for nonrecombinant {H1N1} viruses, for recombinant {H1N1} viruses, and for {H3N2} viruses and that, in general, pairs of viruses exhibited increasing numbers of changes in their oligonucleotide maps as the time interval between isolation of the viruses increased.},

	Abstract = {Laboratory investigations of virus isolation and serum antibodies in a Mediterranean country {(Italy)} demonstrated that influenza A and B viruses, and often both, circulated every winter in Italy. The winter 1987/88 was characterized by a low level of influenza activity, as shown by the limited number (47) of influenza virus isolates, the majority of which (61\%) belonged to the influenza B type. In contrast, the 1988/89 influenza season was exclusively associated with the circulation of influenza type A viruses. The {A(H1H1)} subtype was largely predominant (97\%), as compared to the low incidence of the {A(H3N2)} subtype (3\%). During the 1989/90 winter a co-circulation of A and B influenza viruses was observed, {A(H3N2)} strains being responsible for 96\% of the virologically confirmed cases. Antigenic analysis of the virus isolates showed some antigenic variation in influenza A viruses of both {H1N1} and {H3N2} subtypes, whilst antigenic stability was found among the influenza B virus isolates. Overall, the above virological findings correlate with the data concerning the pattern of influenza virus circulation in Northern Europe and the {UK} during the three years surveyed.

	Abstract = {Two genetically distinct lineages of {H1N1} influenza A viruses, circulated worldwide before 1994, were antigenically indistinguishable. In 1994, viruses emerged in China, including {A/Beijing/262/95}, with profound antigenic differences from the contemporary circulating {H1N1} strains. Haemagglutinin sequence comparisons of either a predecessor virus, {A/Hebei/52/94}, or one representative of the cocirculating {A/Bayern/7/95-like} clade, {A/Shenzhen/227/95}, revealed a deletion of K at position 134 {(H3} numbering) in the antigenic variants. The K134 deletion conferred a selective advantage to the Chinese deletion lineage, such that it eventually gave rise to currently circulating H1 viruses. Using reverse genetics to generate viruses with either an insertion or deletion of aa 134, we have confirmed that the K134 deletion, rather than a constellation of sublineage specific amino acid changes, was sufficient for the antigenic difference observed in the Chinese deletion lineage, and reinsertion of K134 revealed the requirement of a compatible neuraminidase surface glycoprotein for viral growth.},

Most of the variants showed very minor changes and did not achieve epidemiological significance. Genome analysis by ribonucleic acid-ribonucleic acid hybridization, and supported by oligonucleotide mapping, indicated that nonrecombinant {H1N1} viruses cocirculated in the world with recombinant {H1N1} viruses, identified in 1978 to 1979. The results of our antigenic analysis and genomic analysis, in conjunction with genomic analysis by other authors, showed that recombinants with {A/USSR/90/77-like} and {A/Brazil/11/78-like} hemagglutinin had different genome compositions, indicating that {H3N2} virus recombined separately with these different antigenic variants. Prevalence of the nonrecombinant and recombinant {H1N1} viruses varied between regions of the world, and influenza {A(H1N1)} virus with a genotype almost identical to that of nonrecombinant {A/Brazil/11/78} virus reappeared as a cause of local outbreaks in the United States in 1980 despite the predominance of recombinant {H1N1} strains in the preceding winter.},

The results obtained with five different monoclones to each molecule were compared with the results obtained with postinfection ferret sera. Monoclonal antibodies and postinfection ferret sera detected antigenic drift in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules of {H1N1} viruses and monoclonal antibodies showed that the {A/USSR/90/77}, A/ Roma/1/49, and {A/Fort} Warren/1/50 viruses were identical at five sites on both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules. To further evaluate monoclonal antibodies, they were used in hemagglutination inhibition tests with recently isolated influenza {A(HlNl)} viruses, including some shown in tests with postinfection ferret sera to have undergone antigenic drift. Three patterns of reactivity with the monoclonal antibodies were detected with the variants: two variants differed at two of the five sites identified by the monoclonal antibodies and a third variant differed at only one of the five sites. Two of these variant groupings had not been distinguished from each other in {HI} tests with ferret sera, whereas ferret sera were capable of distinguishing between two groups of variants that had similar reaction patterns with the five monoclonal antibody preparations. Monoclonal antibodies failed to detect antigenic drift in the {NA} molecules of the recent isolates of {H1N1} influenza viruses, suggesting that antigenic changes occur less frequently in this molecule. The observation that antigenic differences could be detected between the recent variants with such a small panel of monoclonal antibodies (less than 10\% of the number obtained to the {HA} of {A/PR/8/34)} suggests that monoclonal antibodies may provide an exquisitely sensitive method for antigenic mapping of influenza viruses.},

	Abstract = {After 2 minor winter seasons, influenza B viruses were predominantly isolated in the Province of Quebec, Canada, during the 2000--2001 season representing 74\% of laboratory-confirmed influenza viruses. We performed an antigenic study of the hemagglutinin {(HA)} protein and a molecular characterization of the {HA1} region, nonstructural-1 {(NS1)} and neuraminidase {(NA)/NB} genes of 20 influenza B strains isolated in the Province of Quebec during the 1998--2001 period. Our isolates were compared to recent vaccine strains {(B/Harbin/7/94} in 1998--1999, {B/Yamanashi/166/98} in 1999--2000 and 2000--2001, and {B/Sichuan/379/99} in 2001--2002). The hemagglutination inhibition {(HI)} test revealed that all isolates were different from {B/Harbin/7/94} and were more related to the 2 other vaccine strains although precise identification was often impossible. Molecular analysis of the {HA1} gene revealed that both {B/Yamanashi/166/98-like} and {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} isolates co-circulated during the 1998--1999 season whereas isolates from the 2 subsequent years were more related to {B/Sichuan/379/99.} Most isolates (8/9) of the 2000--2001 season contained a {N126D} substitution recently associated with altered antigenicity in recent influenza {B/Yamagata/16/88-related} viruses. Although the {HA1} and {NS1} protein sequences of viruses isolated during the 1998--1999 season were clearly different from those of the respective vaccine strain {(B/Harbin/7/94)}, the {NA} protein sequence of those isolates was slightly more related to {B/Harbin/7/94} than {B/Yamanashi/166/98} suggesting distinct patterns of evolution for these genes. This study confirms the importance of a detailed molecular analysis for understanding the evolution of influenza B viruses.},

	Abstract = {Although the haemagglutination inhibition assay is considered the ``gold standard'' for antigenic characterisation of influenza viruses, some limitations of this technique are well known. A new microneutralisation assay, as a tool for antigenic characterisation of influenza B viruses, has been standardised and its performance evaluated in comparison with the haemagglutination inhibition test in the light of molecular characterisation of the haemagglutinin. Twelve B viruses belonging to the two lineages and the four sub-lineages discriminated by phylogenetic analysis of {HA} were tested. The microneutralisation assay clearly distinguishes viruses belonging to different lineages and, in addition, discriminates strains belonging to different sub-lineages that are poorly or not discriminated using the haemagglutination inhibition test. This new microneutralisation assay could provide a useful tool for antigenic characterisation of circulating influenza viruses and contribute, together with the haemagglutination inhibition test and sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase, in the choice of the strain for use in vaccine composition.

	Abstract = {During the 2001--2002 influenza season, virological surveillance highlighted the predominant circulation of B viruses (86\% of isolates) in Italy, in contrast to many other countries in Europe and North America where {AH3N2} viruses were isolated most frequently, and in contrast to the infrequent isolation of B viruses in Italy during the previous two years. Associated with this predominance of influenza B was the re-emergence of {B/Victoria/2/87-lineage} viruses, closely related to B viruses prevalent during the 1980s, which are distinct antigenically and genetically from circulating {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} viruses of the {B/Yamagata/16/88} lineage, which predominated in most parts of the world during the last 10 years. Ninety-four viruses isolated in two regions of northern Italy were characterized, 50 by direct sequencing of haemagglutinin {(HA).} Viruses of both Victoria and Yamagata lineages co-circulated throughout the 12 weeks of the influenza season. The {HAs} of the Yamagata-lineage viruses were heterogeneous and comprised two sublineages, represented by {B/Sichuan/379/99} and {B/Harbin/7/94}, whereas the Victoria-lineage viruses were more homogeneous and closely related to {B/Hong} Kong/330/01, the current prototype vaccine strain. The antigenic and genetic characteristics of the viruses correlated with certain epidemiological features. In particular, the low age (\{\textless\}14 years) of individuals infected with {B/Hong} Kong/330/01-like viruses is likely to reflect the greater susceptibility of the youngest cohort, due to lack of previous exposure to Victoria-lineage viruses, and is consistent with the conclusion that vaccination with a {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} virus would give poor protection against infection with {B/Hong} Kong/330/01-like {(Victoria-lineage)} viruses.

	Abstract = {Currently circulating influenza B viruses can be divided into two antigenically and genetically distinct lineages referred to by their respective prototype strains, {B/Yamagata/16/88} and {B/Victoria/2/87}, based on amino acid differences in the hemagglutinin surface glycoprotein. During May and July 2005, clinical specimens from two early season influenza B outbreaks in Arizona and southeastern Nepal were subjected to antigenic (hemagglutinin inhibition) and nucleotide sequence analysis of hemagglutinin {(HA1)}, neuraminidase {(NA)}, and {NB} genes. All isolates exhibited little reactivity with the {B/Shanghai/361/2002} {(B/Yamagata-like)} vaccine strain and significantly reduced reactivity with the previous 2003/04 {B/Hong} Kong/330/2001 {(B/Victoria-like)} vaccine strain. The majority of isolates were antigenically similar to {B/Hawaii/33/2004}, a {B/Victoria-like} reference strain. Sequence analysis indicated that 33 of 34 isolates contained {B/Victoria-like} {HA} and {B/Yamagata-like} {NA} and {NB} proteins. Thus, these outbreak isolates are both antigenically and genetically distinct from the current Northern Hemisphere vaccine virus strain as well as the previous 2003--04 {B/Hong} Kong/330/2001 {(B/Victoria} lineage) vaccine virus strain but are genetically similar to {B/Malaysia/2506/2004}, the vaccine strain proposed for the coming seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

	Abstract = {The unexpectedly low efficacy of influenza vaccine during school outbreaks of influenza B virus in the spring of 1987 in Japan was probably attributable to a poor antibody response of vaccinees to the epidemic viruses. An antigenic analysis of the causative B viruses isolated in 1987 and 1988 showed much variation in hemagglutination inhibition patterns. The nucleotide sequences that code for the {HA1} domain of {B/Fukuoka/c-27/81}, {B/Ibaraki/2/85}, {B/Nagasaki/1/87}, and {B/Yamagata/16/88} viruses were determined and compared with those of the previously reported hemagglutinin genes. The nucleotide sequences of the hemagglutinin gene of a new variant, {B/Yamagata/16/88}, had only 93.4\% homology with those of two other viruses from the same epidemic. An analysis of nucleotide and amino acid substitutions of the hemagglutinin genes of influenza B viruses revealed that new and some old variants could cocirculate in the same epidemic. A phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining method allowed estimation of an evolutionary rate of 2.3 x 10(-3) synonymous (silent) substitutions per nucleotide site per year in the hemagglutinin gene.},

	Abstract = {To characterize the antigenic and genetic relationships of influenza B viruses isolated during the 2004--2005 season, a total of 11,707 clinical respiratory samples were tested of which 1572 (13.5\%) were positive for influenza (463 type A and 1109 type B influenza). Of the type B viruses, 348 isolates collected in different parts of Taiwan were further analyzed. Viruses belonging to both influenza B lineages, {B/Yamagata/16/88} {(B/Yam)} and {B/Victoris/2/87} {(B/Vic)} were detected, although an increasing number of {B/Vic} lineage isolates was obtained as the season progressed. Recent {B/Vic-lineage} isolates were found to have additional amino acid substitutions compared to isolates from previous seasons, indicating that viruses of this lineage continue to evolve significantly and may have the capacity to become the dominant influenza B viruses worldwide. Results presented in this report demonstrate that antigenically and genetically distinct viruses within both {B/Vic} and {B/Yam} lineages co-circulate and that reassortment among these two lineages occurs frequently contributing to the genetic diversity of the circulating strains.},

	Abstract = {To characterize the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses isolated during one influenza season, the antigenic and genetic relationships among 20 strains of influenza B virus isolated in February and March 2001 at one pediatric clinic in Yamagata City, Japan, were investigated. The {HA} gene and seven other gene segments were phylogenetically divided into three distinct sublineages {(Harbin/7/94-}, Tokyo/6/98-, and {Shiga/T30/98-related} lineage) of the Yamagata/16/88-like lineage. The {NS} genes of the viruses belonging to the Harbin/7/94-related lineage have additional three nucleotides at positions 439--447, and were phylogenetically distinguishable from those of the currently circulating Yamagata/16/88- and Victoria/2/87-like lineages, but were closely related to that of the Yamagata/16/88-like lineage isolated before 1994. Moreover, four strains of influenza B virus isolated in the same community between 2002 and 2003 were further examined. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that a virus of Victoria/2/87-like lineage isolated in 2003 had acquired the {NA}, {NS}, M, and {PA} gene segments from a {Shiga/T30/98-like} virus, and two strains of Harbin/7/94-related lineage had acquired the various gene segments from {Shiga/T30/98-like} virus through a reassortment event. These results indicate that genetically distinct multiple viruses can combine to cause an influenza B epidemic in a community and that the frequent reassortment among these viruses plays a role in generating the genetic diversity of influenza B viruses.

Here, we investigated the antigenic and genetic characteristics of influenza B viruses isolated from children living in Lusaka, Zambia between January and May 1999. Antigenic analysis with chicken antiviral sera showed that all the Zambian isolates had the {HA} protein belonging to {B/Yamagata/16/88-related} lineage. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of the eight {RNA} segments performed by using the total or partial nucleotide sequences of the two representative Zambian strains {(B/Lusaka/270/99} and {B/Lusaka/432/99)} as well as the previously reported sequences suggested that the Zambian viruses are closely related to the recently circulating reassortants represented by {B/Shiga/T30/98} and {B/Yamanashi/166/98} which acquired the genes coding for three polymerase proteins {(PB2}, {PB1}, and {PA)}, {HA}, nucleoprotein, and matrix protein from a {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} parent and the gene encoding nonstructural proteins {(NS1} and {NS2)} from a {B/Guandong/8/93-like} parent.},

	Abstract = {New antigenic variants of {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} lineage which appeared in the season of 1997 as a minor strain tended to predominate in the following season. Also, we could observe for the first time, three peaks of activity caused by {H3N2} virus and two variants of B influenza virus. Antigenic and phylogenetic analyses revealed that {B/Victoria/2/87-like} variants appeared again in Japan in 1997 after a nine-year absence. Influenza B viruses evolved into three major lineages, including the earliest strain {(I)}, {B/Yamagata/16/88-like} variants {(II)}, which comprised of three sublineages {(II-(i)}, {II-(ii)}, {II-(iii))}, and {B/Victoria/2/87-like} variants {(III).} Evolution of influenza B virus hemagglutinin was apparently distinguishable from that of influenza A virus, showing a systematic mechanism of nucleotide deletion and insertion. This phenomenon was observed to be closely related to evolutionary pathways of I, {II-(i)}, {II-(ii)}, {II-(iii)} and {III} lineages. It was noteworthy to reveal that the nucleotide deletion and insertion mechanism of influenza B virus completed one cycle over a fifty-year period, and that a three nucleotide deletion was again observed in 1997 strains belonging to lineage {II-(} iii). It was evident that amino acid substitutions accompanying nucleotide insertions were highly conserved.},

	Abstract = {Throughout most of the last decade, {B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage} influenza viruses were predominant among the B isolates circulating worldwide, whereas {B/Victoria/2/87-lineage} viruses were isolated infrequently and restricted geographically to eastern Asia. During the 2001--02 influenza season, {B/Victoria/2/87-lineage} viruses re-emerged in North America and Europe and spread worldwide. Virological surveillance in Italy during that season showed wide circulation of influenza B viruses, of which most were antigenically related to the {B/Sichuan/379/99} {(Yamagata-lineage)} vaccine strain, together with a smaller number of B viruses antigenically similar to {B/HongKong/330/01}, a recent {B/Victoria/2/87-lineage} antigenic variant. In the subsequent 2002--03 epidemic season, B viruses with a Victoria-lineage hemagglutinin {(HA)}, more closely related to that of {B/Shandong/7/97}, were isolated exclusively. Similar strains have continued to predominate among the few B viruses isolated in Italy during last season (2003--04), although most influenza B viruses, isolated sporadically elsewhere in Europe, again belong to the Yamagata-lineage. In the present study, phylogenetic analyses of the {HA} and neuraminidase {(NA)} genes of representative B strains, isolated throughout Italy during 2001--04, showed that during the first influenza season the {NA} genes, as well as the {HA} genes, separated into the two distinct clades, the Yamagata- and Victoria-lineages, and showed no evidence of genetic reassortment. On the contrary, all the B viruses isolated in the 2002--03 and most of those isolated in the 2003--04 epidemic season were {``Victoria} {HA--Yamagata} {NA''} reassortants similar to those isolated in other parts of the world, showing that these reassortants became established in the human population. The frequency of reassortment between {HA} and {NA} of distinct lineages and sublineages highlights again the importance of detailed molecular analyses of both surface glycoproteins in understanding the evolution of influenza B viruses.

	Abstract = {During 1988--1989 two highly distinct antigenic variants of influenza type B were recognized in hemagglutination-inhibition tests with postinfection ferret serum. These viruses were antigenically related to either {BNictoria/2/87}, the most recent reference strain, or {BNamagata/16/88}, a variant that was isolated in Japan in May 1988. All influenza B viruses isolated in the United States during an epidemic in the winter of 1988--1989 were antigenically related to B/ Victoria/2/87. However, in several countries in Asia, both {BNictoria/2/87-like} viruses and {BNamagata/16/88-like} viruses were isolated. Sequence analysis of the hemagglutinin {(HA)} genes of several influenza B isolates from 1987 to 1988 indicated that the {HA1} domains of the {BNamagata/16/88-like} viruses and {B/VI/87-like} viruses isolated in 1988 differed by 27 amino acids. Evolutionary relationships based on this sequence data indicated that the {BNamagata/16/} 88-like viruses were more closely related to epidemic viruses from 1983 {(B/USSR/100/83-like} viruses) than to more recent reference strains such as {BNictoria/2/87.} All other Asian strains, as well as selected isolates from the United States in 1988, were confirmed by sequence analysis as being genetically related to {BNictoria/2/87.} These data provide clear evidence that two parallel evolutionary pathways of influenza type B have existed since at least 1983 and that viruses from each of the separate lineages were isolated from cases of influenza B in 1988. This finding is similar to earlier observations for type A H 1 N1 and {H3N2} influenza viruses.},

From March to September of 2001 and during the 2001--2002 influenza season, Victoria lineage viruses were detected for the first time in a decade in several countries including Canada, {USA}, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Philippines, India, and Oman. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin {(HA)} gene of these viruses revealed that the viruses fell into two distinct clades: one group, represented by the reference strain {B/Hong} Kong/330/2001, contained viruses sharing three signature amino acids, Arg116, Asn121, and Glu164, while the other group of viruses, represented by {B/Oman/16296/2001}, shared Thr121 compared to the previous reference strain, {B/Shandong/7/97.} A number of the viruses in the latter group have been found to be reassortants having a Victoria lineage {HA} and a Yamagata lineage {NA.} In the current 2001--2002 season, Victoria-like viruses have now been associated with outbreaks in Asia, Europe, and North America. The reemergence of these Victoria lineage viruses worldwide, the fact that the majority of the {B/Victoria-like} isolates have poor cross-reactivity to {B/Sichuan/379/99-like} viruses in current vaccines, and the lack of exposure of young children in many areas of the world to these viruses has resulted in a World Health Organization Northern Hemisphere recommendation for the inclusion of a {B/Victoria-like} strain in vaccines for the 2002--2003 influenza season.},

@article{Xu04,
	Abstract = {During the 2001--2002 influenza season, human influenza A {(H1N2)} reassortant viruses were detected globally. The hemagglutinin {(HA)} of these {H1N2} viruses was similar to that of the {A/New} Caledonia/20/99 {(H1N1)} vaccine strain both antigenically and genetically, while their neuraminidase {(NA)} was antigenically and genetically related to that of recent human influenza {H3N2} reference viruses such as {A/Moscow/10/99.} All six internal genes of the {H1N2} reassortants originated from an {H3N2} virus. After being detected only in eastern Asia during the past 10 years, Influenza {B/Victoria/2/87} lineage viruses reappeared in many countries outside of Asia in 2001. Additionally, reassortant influenza B viruses possessing an {HA} similar to that of {B/Shandong/7/97}, a recent {B/Victoria/2/87} lineage reference strain, and an {NA} closely related to that of {B/Sichuan/379/99}, a recent {B/Yamagata/16/88} lineage reference strain, were isolated globally and became the predominant influenza B epidemic strain. The current influenza vaccine is expected to provide good protection against {H1N2} viruses because it contains {A/New} Caledonia/20/99 {(H1N1)} and {A/Panama/2007/99} {(H3N2)} like viruses whose H1 {HA} or N2 {NA} are antigenically similar to those of recent circulating {H1N2} viruses. On the other hand, widespread circulation of influenza B Victoria lineage viruses required inclusion of a strain from this lineage in influenza vaccines for the 2002--2003 season.},
