		- MCMC output: too much data, so not uploaded online: 
			- in the external harddrive: C:\researchData\clustering\
				- mainly in the "forManuscript"  for replicate 1 to 4 for H1N1 and H3N2 and "forManuscripts-moreReplicates" for replicate 5-10
			- copied the first replicate to the shared Dropbox:  ... Dropbox\antigenic-clustering\MCMC-outputs
		- some results of the analysis I did: in the shared dropbox: .. Dropbox\antigenic-clustering
